# AfikAccounting — Accounting & Financial Engine

A full-stack accounting portal that pairs a **Smart Accounting Solution Engine** (IFRS 16, IAS 16, IAS 37, Israeli corporate tax / IAS 12) with a **video and article Content Hub**.

Built with Next.js 16 (App Router, Cache Components), React 19, Tailwind CSS 4, Motion, Lucide and Supabase (Postgres + Auth).

## Quick start

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local   # optional — see "Demo mode"
npm run dev                  # http://localhost:3000
```

### Demo mode

If the Supabase variables are missing, the site still runs in full: the engine works, and content comes from the bundled seed data in `src/lib/content/seed.ts`. Sign-in, saving and the dashboard are turned off until you connect Supabase.

## Connecting Supabase

1. Create a project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com).
2. In **Project Settings → API**, copy the project URL, the publishable (anon) key and the service-role key into `.env.local`:

   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://xxxx.supabase.co
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=sb_publishable_...
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=...        # only used by the seed script
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=http://localhost:3000
   ```

3. Apply the schema. Either paste `supabase/migrations/20261022000000_init.sql` into the **SQL editor**, or use the CLI:

   ```bash
   npx supabase link --project-ref <ref>
   npx supabase db push
   ```

4. Seed the content library and calculator schemas:

   ```bash
   npm run db:seed
   ```

5. In **Authentication → URL configuration**, set the Site URL to `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` and add `http://localhost:3000/auth/confirm` to the redirect URLs. In **Authentication → Email templates**, point the *Confirm signup* and *Reset password* links at:

   ```
   {{ .RedirectTo }}&token_hash={{ .TokenHash }}&type={{ .Type }}
   ```

   The app already sets the redirect to `/auth/confirm?next=…`, so this only adds the token.

   (For local testing you can turn off email confirmation instead.)

6. Restart `npm run dev`.

To attach real recordings, upload them to Supabase Storage (or any CDN) and set `video_url` on the `content` row. Until then, lessons play a simulated timeline so chapters and progress tracking still work. You can also set `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_VIDEO_URL` to one MP4 that every lesson without a recording will play.

## Admin portal (`/admin`)

Analytics dashboard, media library (uploads to Supabase Storage, or YouTube / Vimeo embeds), content editor and scenario presets.

1. Apply `supabase/migrations/20261023000000_admin.sql` the same way as the initial schema. It adds the `role` column on profiles, the `media_assets`, `scenario_presets` and `analytics_events` tables, the public `media` storage bucket, and the `admin_analytics` / `admin_storage` functions.
2. Sign up on the site, then make yourself an admin in the SQL editor:

   ```sql
   update public.profiles set role = 'admin'
   where id = (select id from auth.users where email = 'you@example.com');
   ```

3. Open **מערכת ניהול** from the user menu, or go to `/admin`.

**Growth funnel (`/admin/funnel`).** Apply `supabase/migrations/20261108030000_admin_funnel.sql` and `20261108040000_admin_funnel_exam_mode.sql`. The funnel from entry to payment (entry → first answer → activation → sign-up → back on another day → paywall → plan → checkout → payment), sources (ambassador `?ref=`, `utm_source`, referring site, direct — click one to filter everything), weekly learners with 10+ answers, retention by first-visit week, the habit features (review, streaks, exam dates, groups, reminders, shares), each lesson's accuracy and trap fall rate, the traps that catch most readers, paywall gates, the summary check and exam mode (counted apart) — each against the period before. Aggregated in the database by `public.admin_funnel()` (admins only, aggregates only); `supabase/tests/funnel.test.ts` checks the numbers.

**Ambassadors (`/admin/ambassadors`).** Apply `supabase/migrations/20261108060000_admin_ambassadors.sql`. For each `?ref=` code: browsers that entered through it, Activation, sign-ups and payments. A browser belongs to the first link it came through, so a later return or payment still counts for that code.

**A/B experiments.** Apply `supabase/migrations/20261108050000_experiments.sql`. Experiments live in `src/lib/experiments.ts`: the page under test, its variants (the first is the control) and `active`. While an experiment runs, the proxy puts each visitor in one variant (a 90-day cookie) and serves that variant's prerendered page (`/x/<experiment>/<variant>`, not indexed) at the same address, so the page stays static and nothing flashes. Off, everyone gets the control; `?ab=<experiment>:<variant>` previews a variant either way. Each exposure is an `experiment_view` event; `/admin/funnel` shows every variant's visitors, answers, activation, sign-ups and payments, with a two-proportion test against the control. The first experiment, `hero` (the home headline: summary vs practice, against "two doors"), ships off — turn it on at launch.

Access is enforced in three places: the proxy (signed-in only), every admin page and Server Action (`requireAdmin` / `assertAdmin`), and the database itself (`public.is_admin()` in every admin policy; users cannot change their own role).

Usage analytics are anonymous: a random id per browser tab, never linked to an account unless the visitor is signed in. Events are sent with `navigator.sendBeacon` to `/api/track`, validated there, and aggregated in the database (`admin_analytics`). Admin pages are not tracked.

## Payments (`BILLING_PROVIDER`)

Plans and prices live in `src/lib/pricing.ts`; access is always read from `public.subscriptions` through `getAccess()`. A payment provider only writes that table — the course pages, lessons and exams area never know it exists. With `BILLING_PROVIDER` unset, payments are off and every "choose a plan" button signs the reader up with the plan noted, as before; manual grants in `/admin/subscriptions` work either way.

**The flow.** `/pricing` (or a paywall, which passes `?from=` — the locked lesson) → `/checkout?plan=…&interval=…` → sign up or in if needed (the forms carry `?next=` back) → the provider's hosted payment page → `/checkout/thanks`, which waits for the webhook and sends the reader back to the lesson they came from. `/profile` shows the plan, the renewal date and the invoices, and lets the reader change plan or cancel; a cancellation keeps the plan open until the end of the period paid for.

**The webhook** is `POST /api/billing/webhook`. It verifies the provider's signature on the raw body (a bad one → 400, nothing stored), normalizes the event to one of `activated`, `renewed`, `plan_changed`, `cancel_scheduled`, `cancel_revoked`, `canceled`, `payment_failed`, `refunded`, and applies it with the service role through `public.apply_billing_event()` — in one transaction that first records the provider's event id in `billing_events`. A repeated delivery is answered 200 as a duplicate and applied once; an event older than the last one applied to the same subscription is ignored as stale. Each charge's invoice link is kept in `invoices` (each reader sees their own).

**Setup**

1. Apply `supabase/migrations/20261102000000_billing.sql` (after the earlier migrations).
2. In `.env.local` (or the host's environment): `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, `BILLING_PROVIDER`, `BILLING_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, and the provider's own keys. No secret is ever in the code.
3. At the provider: set the webhook address to `<NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL>/api/billing/webhook` with the same secret, turn on recurring billing, and turn on **an automatic tax invoice / receipt for every charge** (required in Israel; the provider's invoicing module or its linked invoicing service issues it — the site only keeps the link).

**Developing without a provider.** `BILLING_PROVIDER=sandbox` (any long `BILLING_WEBHOOK_SECRET`) runs a built-in stand-in: a test payment page at `/billing/sandbox` (any card succeeds, a card ending in `0002` is declined), signed webhooks to the real webhook route, test invoices marked as such, and buttons in `/profile` for what the provider would send later (renewal, failed charge, refund, end of period). It refuses to run unless `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` is localhost (or `BILLING_SANDBOX_ALLOW_REMOTE=1` on a staging site).

**Adding a real provider.** Write `src/lib/billing/providers/<name>.ts` implementing `PaymentProvider` (`src/lib/billing/types.ts`): `createCheckout` (its hosted payment page, with our user id and plan in the metadata it echoes back), `verifyWebhook` (its signature scheme, and its event types mapped to ours), `cancelAtPeriodEnd` and `changePlan` (its API). Add it to the switch in `src/lib/billing/index.ts`, its keys to `.env.example`, and its webhook samples to `src/lib/billing/billing.test.ts`.

## Study habits, groups and reminders

Apply `supabase/migrations/20261108020000_habits_groups.sql` (after the earlier migrations).

- **Habits** (`study_habits`): a signed-in reader's study days (the streak) and exam dates follow them between devices; the browser merges them with the account on arrival (`study-mode/progress-sync.tsx`).
- **Study groups** (`/groups`): a reader opens a group for a course and shares its invite link (`/groups/join/<code>`). Members see who studied today; readiness and streak only for members who chose to share them. Everything goes through row-level security and the `create_study_group` / `join_study_group` / `study_group_preview` functions; `supabase/tests/groups.test.ts` checks the rules.
- **Reminders** (opt-in in `/profile`): the scheduler in `vercel.json` calls `GET /api/reminders` daily with `Authorization: Bearer <CRON_SECRET>`. A reader gets at most one email a day, only on a day they haven't studied, and only with mistakes due for review or an exam within two weeks. Every email has a one-click unsubscribe (`/api/reminders/unsubscribe`, signed with `REMINDERS_SECRET`). Set `EMAIL_PROVIDER=resend`, `RESEND_API_KEY` and `EMAIL_FROM` to send; without them the route is a dry run that reports what it would send. It needs `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`.

## How the engine works

Each calculator in `src/lib/engine/calculators/` is a **JSON-serialisable schema** (scenario fields, metric fields, conditional visibility, explainer-video timestamps) plus a `solve()` function. The same schema drives:

- the wizard UI (`components/engine/wizard.tsx`),
- validation on the client, in Server Actions and in the API (`lib/engine/validate.ts`),
- the `accounting_calculators.schema` column in the database.

`solve()` returns the headline, metrics, journal entries (checked to balance), schedule tables, a disclosure note, guidance with paragraph references, and assumptions.

To add a calculator, create a file in `calculators/`, register it in `registry.ts`, add tests to `engine.test.ts` and run `npm run db:seed`.

### API

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/calculators
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/calculators/ifrs-16-leases \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"values":{"payment":100,"termYears":5,"discountRate":5,"usefulLife":10}}'
```

Missing fields take their defaults. Invalid inputs return `422` with errors for each field.

## Security notes

- Auth uses Supabase sessions in HTTP-only cookies. `proxy.ts` refreshes the session and gates `/dashboard` and `/profile`. Every page and action also verifies the user itself through `lib/auth/dal.ts`.
- All user tables use row-level security scoped to `auth.uid()`.
- Saved solutions are re-validated and re-computed on the server before they are stored.
- Never expose `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` with a `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix.
